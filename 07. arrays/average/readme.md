# Average Calculator in C

This is a beginner-friendly C program that calculates the average of **three numbers** entered by the user.  
I used:

- An **array** to store the numbers  
- A **custom function** to compute the average  

It’s a small project, but it helped me practice working with arrays, functions, and basic user input in C.

## 💡 How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter three numbers.  
2. It stores them in an array.  
3. A function takes the array as input and returns the average.  
4. The final average is printed out.

## 🚀 Purpose
Just practicing C fundamentals — arrays, functions, and clean logic.

 This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning CS50X C.
I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.
