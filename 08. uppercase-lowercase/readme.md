# Case Flipper

A simple C program that reads a string from the user and flips the case of each character.  
Lowercase letters become uppercase, and uppercase letters become lowercase.

## How It Works
- User enters any text.
- Program loops through each character.
- Converts lowercase → uppercase, and uppercase → lowercase.
- Prints the transformed text.

## Technologies Used
- C
- `<ctype.h>` for `toupper()` / `tolower()`
- `<string.h>` for `strlen()`
- CS50 Library (`get_string`)

### 🧠 This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning CS50X C. I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.
