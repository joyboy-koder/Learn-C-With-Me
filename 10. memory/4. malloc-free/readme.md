# String Copy & Memory Allocation — CS50 Practice

This project is a CS50-inspired exercise focusing on dynamic memory allocation, string copying, and basic string manipulation in C.  
The program takes an input string from the user, manually copies it into newly allocated memory, modifies the first character, and then prints both versions.

---

## 📌 What the Program Demonstrates
- Using `get_string()` to receive user input  
- Allocating memory dynamically with `malloc()`  
- Safely checking for allocation failure  
- Copying a string character-by-character  
- Modifying the copied string without affecting the original  
- Using `toupper()` to capitalize characters  
- Freeing dynamically allocated memory to avoid leaks  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- **Pointers & dynamic memory**
- **String manipulation**
- **Memory safety**
- **Working with `malloc`, `strlen`, and `toupper`**
- **Understanding how modifying a copy doesn’t change the original**

## 🎓 Why I Built This
I wrote this program while studying CS50’s Memory section to deepen my understanding of:
- How strings work under the hood  
- How to properly allocate and free memory  
- How copying data manually helps avoid unintended side effects
