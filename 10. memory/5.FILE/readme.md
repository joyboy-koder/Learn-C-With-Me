# Phonebook CSV Writer — CS50 Practice

This is a simple C program I created while practicing file handling in CS50.  
It takes a user's name and phone number as input and appends the data to a CSV file called `phonebook.csv`.

---

## 📌 What the Program Does
- Opens (or creates) `phonebook.csv` in append mode  
- Prompts the user for a name and phone number  
- Writes the data into the file in CSV format (`name,number`)  
- Closes the file safely after writing  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced
- Opening and working with files using `fopen()`  
- Writing to files with `fprintf()`  
- Handling file pointers  
- Appending data to existing files  
- Basic CSV formatting  
- Ensuring safe file closing with `fclose()`

## 🎓 Why I Built This
I wrote this while learning about file I/O in CS50 to understand:
- How programs can store user data permanently  
- How to work with external files  
- How CSV files are structured and written  

A simple but important step toward building more complex data storage programs.
