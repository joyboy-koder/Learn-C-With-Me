# Dynamic Memory Allocation Example in C

This program demonstrates how to use **dynamic memory allocation** in C using `malloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`. It shows how to create an array in memory, resize it safely, and properly free memory to avoid leaks.

---

## 📌 What This Program Does

1. Allocates memory for an array of **3 integers** using `malloc()`.
2. Stores the values **1, 2, 3** in the array.
3. Prints the three values.
4. Uses `realloc()` to **expand the array** to 4 integers.
5. Adds a new value (**4**) to the expanded array.
6. Prints all four values.
7. Correctly frees all allocated memory before exiting.

## 🧠 This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning CS50X. I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.
