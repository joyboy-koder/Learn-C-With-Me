# Functions Project in C – Version 2 (Meow with User Input)

**Project Name:** Meow Function – User Controlled Version  
**Language:** C  
**Concepts:** Functions with `void`, user input, variables, loops, function calls  

---

## 📌 Description

This is the **second version** of the Meow Function project.  
In this version, the program:

1. Asks the user to enter a number.  
2. Stores that number in a variable `n`.  
3. Uses a `for` loop to call the function `meow()` **n** times.  
4. Prints `"Meow"` according to the user’s input.

This version shows how functions, loops, and user input all work together in a clean and reusable structure.
