# Functions Project in C – Version 3 (Input Validation with do…while Loop)

**Project Name:** Meow Function – Validated User Input  
**Language:** C  
**Concepts:** Functions, do…while loop, input validation, user interaction, loops  

---

## 📌 Description

This is the **third version** of the Meow Function project.  
In this version, the program improves user experience by validating input:

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.  
2. If the number is **negative**, the program asks again.  
3. A `do…while` loop ensures the prompt repeats until a **positive number** is entered.  
4. Once valid input is received, a `for` loop calls the `meow()` function **n** times.

This version introduces reliable input validation — a core skill in programming.

## 🧠 What This Version Taught Me

- How the **do…while loop** guarantees at least one user prompt  
- Repeating input prompts until user enters a valid (positive) number  
- Clean and reusable code using custom functions  
- Combining multiple concepts:
  - Functions  
  - Loops  
  - Validation  
  - User interaction
