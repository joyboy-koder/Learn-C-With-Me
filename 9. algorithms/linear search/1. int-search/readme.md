# Linear Search (Integer Search)

This C program performs a simple **linear search** on an array of integers.  
The user enters a number, and the program checks if the number exists in the array.

## How It Works
- A fixed array of integers is defined:  
  `{5, 20, 35, 50, 100, 150, 70}`
- The user types a number.
- The program loops through the array one element at a time.
- If the number matches any element, it prints **"Found"**.
- If the loop ends with no match, it prints **"Not found"**.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays  
- For loops  
- Linear search algorithm  
- CS50's `get_int()`  
- Basic conditional checks

### This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning Linear Search Algorithm. I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.
