# Linear Search (String Search)

This C program performs a **linear search on an array of strings**.  
The user enters a word, and the program checks if it matches any of the stored strings.

## How It Works
- An array of 5 strings is defined:  
  `"books"`, `"street"`, `"humans"`, `"tortoise"`, `"extreme"`
- The user inputs a string.
- The program loops through the array and compares each element to the user’s input using `strcmp()`.
- If a match is found, it prints **"Found"**.
- If no match is found after checking all items, it prints **"Not found"**.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays of strings  
- Linear search algorithm  
- CS50's `get_string()`  
- `strcmp()` for string comparison  
- For loops and conditional checks

### This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning Linear Algorithm. I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.
