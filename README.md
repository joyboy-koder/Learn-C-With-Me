# Learn C With Me

Welcome to my C programming journey!  
This repository documents all my practice programs, experiments, and CS50 problem set solutions as I learn C from scratch using the CS50 curriculum.

## 📘 What You’ll Find Here

### 🔹Fundamental C programs and concepts:
- Variables  
- Conditions  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Input & Output  
- Simple programs using the CS50 Library (`cs50.h`)

### 🔹 cs50-problem-sets
My solutions to CS50’s weekly problem sets.  
These programs follow the official CS50 specifications.

## 🛠️ How to Run These Programs

These programs use **CS50 Library functions** (like `get_string()` and `get_int()`), so you should run them in the **CS50.dev environment**.

To compile:

```bash
make filename
```
To run:
```bash
./filename
```
### 📚 About the CS50 Library

Some programs in this repository include:
```bash
#include <cs50.h>
```
This library provides beginner-friendly functions for input and other utilities.
These programs are intended to run on cs50.dev, CS50’s cloud IDE.

## 🧠 This project was built with guidance and examples while I was learning CS50X C. I modified and tested everything myself to understand how it works.

# Completed my CS50X C journey — final project: Data Structures.
